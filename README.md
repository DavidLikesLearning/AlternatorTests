# AlternatorTests
EE157 Final Project

Alternator Data.xlsx stores the power supply data for the motor and generator tests.

The AlternatorMotorProcessing.ipynb holds the first attempts at processing the data, includes poor efficiency plots and the computed drag coefficients for the alternator, which can't reasonably correct.

The AlternatorMotorProcessing-Copy2.ipynb holds the raw plots of the collected data included in the paper. Efficiency plots with the parameters from lab 3 are also here.
