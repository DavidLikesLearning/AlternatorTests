# AlternatorTests
EE157 Final Project

Alternator Data.xlsx stores the power supply data for the motor and generator tests.

The AlternatorMotorProcessing.ipynb holds the first attempts at processing the data, includes poor efficiency plots and the computed drag coefficients for the alternator, which can't reasonably correct.

The AlternatorMotorProcessing-Copy2.ipynb holds the raw plots of the collected data included in the paper. Efficiency plots with the parameters from lab 3 are also here. 

The phasesTest folder simpy holds data from initial back EMF tests to determine the wiring of the alternator.

The af# csv and png files hold sample data from the motor tests. One and two go together, three and four do as well. 

the gen# csv and png files hold sample data from the generator tests. Consecutive numbers go together.
